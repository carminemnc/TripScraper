The Music is what gets you,50,Date of stay: March 2023,"Amazing ambience, rooms to stay in, food and specially the music being played in the entrance corridor by Fabio Ferns that caught my attention and made me watch the performance from the start tot he end, it was an amazing experience, would recommend!"
A Grand hotel for Tourists,30,Date of stay: June 2023,"Royal Plaza is located very near to India Gate. A quiet neighbourhood. Antiques in the lobby. On some days , their antique piano is played in the evening. A comfortable hotel with very supportive housekeeping staff. Sumptuous Breakfast spread with attentive staff. They have a garden area and pool with a Microbrewery. Overall a grand looking Hotel. Excellent for doing morning walks to India Gate.

But I feel they are mostly tuned to catering to Tour groups. All rooms payments are taken in advance at Check In, all room service / Laundry
have to be paid then and there---all not usually practiced for Corporate customers. The main draw back is the reception staff who are mechanical. At Check In they dont brief you on what services you get as part of your package. You might end up missing out on Complimentary dinner which ""might"" be actually part of your package.

Rooms are rather small ."

Good stay during the meeting,40,Date of stay: March 2023,"We stayed here three days to attend a meeting (also at the hotel). The room was very small but cosy. It had a large bed with two bedside tables, one confy chair, a safe and tea making facilities. There was also ironing equipment which was handy for dressing up for the meeting. Unfortunately it had no desk. The bathroom was nice with separate shower. Everything was clean. We had a good view from the window with nobody opposite (so you don't need curtains). The WiFi was a hassle as you had to call every day for a new code which was only valid for two gadgets. As we both attended a work meeting (in the hotel) we needed to have our computers online. So I had no WiFi on my phone for 3 days which was a real nuisance. The breakfast buffet was very good. The meeting facilities were very nice too. The snacks and lunch served at the meeting were good. It is a very large hotel and whenever you needed something from the reception long waits were invovled or you had to call room service a couple of times before getting what you needed. But regardless of the slow service we had a good stay at the hotel."

Average,30,Date of stay: April 2023,"We reach the hotel by 10 am and we requested for early check in which was communicated to us by 11 AM, after 1130 am I went to reception to check the room status the receptionist was not even interested to communicate properly and she said it will take another one hour. She wasn‚Äôt interested to have a proper eye contact and whosoever were there at the reception. (I still remember her name, but I don‚Äôt want to mention it, because this review is for her learning and I am sure she will understand

I really appreciate the front office manager who helped me and within a minutes to get a room. Thank you so very much for the support.

Room cleaning and bath towels really need improvement, dental kit , water bottles are basic things which we can keep in the room as it wasn‚Äôt there in the room.

Air conditioning wasn‚Äôt effective in the room also thermostat has issues as it wasn‚Äôt working properly.

Rest everything went well."

Poor Service Minded - Charges for Luggage Storage,30,Date of stay: April 2023,We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and was flying domestically to Amritsar for a night and then re-checking into the hotel for another night. As International travellers we were unable to take all our baggage for the domestic trip. We asked the hotel to store our luggage in the cloak room. This is the first ever hotel where they charge their guests for luggage storage. We were 4 guests with 2 rooms and we had to store 5 pieces of luggage. They charged us INR 200 per piece of baggage and we ended up paying them INR 1000 for just keeping the luggage for 24 hours. Not service minded and poor hospitality. Check in staff were un-professional and cracking jokes and laughing among themselves. The drainage system of the washroom was clogged. Had to inform them to get it done. Overall not a good experience.
Thank-you all staff and service was good,50,Date of stay: April 2023,"The location, the staff managment, Duty Manager along with HK Manager also other staff is highly appreciated everything is in this hotel is excellent.
